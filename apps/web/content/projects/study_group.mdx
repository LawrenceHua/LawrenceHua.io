As Systems Engineer, I designed and implemented robust distributed protocols—Paxos, Raft, and advanced fault tolerance simulations—to ensure data consistency and high availability in complex environments. These projects demonstrate my ability to deliver resilient, scalable systems under real-world constraints.

## Features

- **Consensus Protocols**: Paxos, Raft for distributed agreement
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automated node failure recovery
- **Leader Election**: Reliable, dynamic coordination

## Tech Stack

- **Python**, **gRPC**

## Impact

- Simulated real-world node failures, recovery, and consensus
- Delivered production-grade reliability and uptime

## Role

Systems Engineer
