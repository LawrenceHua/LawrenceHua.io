👥  RECOMMENDATIONS & TESTIMONIALS

**JJ Xu (Founder & CEO @ TalkMeUp | Adjunct Prof. & EIR @ CMU):**
"I had the pleasure of mentoring Lawrence during his time in my Lean Entrepreneurship course, where he developed the first version of Expired Solutions. From the start, Lawrence approached every challenge with curiosity, grit, and a clear desire to create something meaningful. He combined his technical background with a strong product mindset, conducting thoughtful customer discovery and iterating quickly based on feedback. What started as a class project quickly evolved into a finalist in a venture competition. I'm excited to see where he goes next."

**Casey Justus (Director - Strategic Sourcing @ Bath & Body Works):**
"I had the pleasure of working with Lawrence when he supported our team at Bath & Body Works during a project with Kearney. Lawrence approached every conversation with enthusiasm, curiosity, and a strong technical foundation that helped bridge the gap between strategy and implementation. He quickly established himself as a team leader through our direct interactions. He took the time to understand our sourcing challenges and worked closely with us to shape an AI-driven supplier evaluation approach. What stood out was his ability to clearly explain what the solution could (and couldn't) do — helping our team feel confident in what we were building together. Lawrence was collaborative, thoughtful, and always willing to roll up his sleeves to get things right. I truly enjoyed working with him and look forward to seeing all that he accomplishes next."

**Wendy Williams (IT Director at University of Florida):**
"Lawrence Hua was one of my top System Administrators I've had over the last 14 years. He is a conscientious worker and was ready to take on any task I gave him. We have a smaller IT department so we are asked to do many diverse tasks, Lawrence was wonderful in determining what needed to be done and taking on the responsibility of completing the various projects. Lawrence has a very pleasant demeanor and got along well with all the office staff and administration. He was well liked and is missed by everyone. Lawrence is a well spoken, intelligent and hard working individual and he will serve whomever he works for well."

**Shyam Sundar (Android Frameworks Engineer):**
"Over this past summer, I was Lawrence's Mentor during his Android Software Developer Internship. He always starts the day with 'Happy (that)day!' which shows his enthusiasm and energy, he exhibited great skills with his ability to solve complex issues on the front-end, dedication to stay motivated even through a fully online program and adapt to Motorola's technology quickly. He always went the extra mile to ensure all tasks assigned were done to the best of his ability. My time mentoring him was well complemented by his technical ability, hard work, and enthusiasm."
